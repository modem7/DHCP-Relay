# ISC DHCP Relay Agent

![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/modem7/dhcprelay)

A simple ISC DHCP Relay Agent.

The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay, provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which no DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other subnets. It supports both DHCPv4/BOOTP and DHCPv6 protocols.
